This template contains a notebook that illustrates how to calculate the great circle distance between two geographical locations given through latitude and longitude coordinates, as well as:
* Identifying the closest location (from a set of target locations) for each source location
* Identifying all target locations within a certain threshold from the source location

This type of calculation is useful for analyzing footprint and competition.
